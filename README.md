# <p align="center"> Research Internships for Undergraduates </p>

#### <p align="center"> This is a non-exhaustive list of opportunities available to Undergraduate students. Many of these positions are only focused towards Indian students. </p>

<p align="center">
I am making this list as an attempt to fill the void of any such open source list. Your contribution is vital to keep the list up-to-date for future students to use. Hence it's a humble request to each user to contribute any new opportunity you discover and update the old ones. Without updation, the web-links will break, and the list will become futile! I'll make sure that any such modification in the `README.md` raised as an issue or submitted as a pull request be timely reviewed and added.
